# **FeedForward: Decentralized Food Redistribution Platform**

FeedForward is a Web3-powered platform that bridges the gap between surplus food and those in need. It uses blockchain technology for transparency, decentralized governance, and reward systems. With FeedCoin (an ERC-20 token) and NFT achievements, the platform incentivizes participation while fostering sustainability.

2. Built on the Sepolia blockchain, FeedForward ensures immutable records of food donations and rewards.  
3. Our DAO governance empowers community members to shape the platform's future through decentralized decision-making.  
4. By gamifying contributions with FeedCoin and NFTs, we create an engaging, impactful ecosystem for reducing food waste.
